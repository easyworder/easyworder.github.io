	<h1>Money and Economics</h1>
	<img src="../../img/text1.jpg" style="width: 252px; height: 142px;">
	<p>Money is the most disputable thing of all times.
	It appeared
	thousands years ago at the initial stage of civilization.
	People started to produce more bread, milk, wool, and other valuables than they could consume. So they started to exchange some <b>surplus</b> with their neighbors. Later money was invented to simplify the "barter relations"<br>
	Economics (from the Greek "household management") is a social science that studies the production, distribution, trade and <b>consumption</b> of goods and services.<br>
	Economics, which focuses on measurable variables, is broadly divided into two main branches: microeconomics, which deals with individual agents, such as <b>households</b> and businesses, and macroeconomics, which considers the economy as a whole, in which case it considers aggregate supply and demand for money, capital and commodities. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are resource allocation, production, distribution, trade, and competition. Economic logic is increasingly applied to any problem that involves choice under <b>scarcity</b> or determining economic value. Mainstream economics focuses on how prices reflect supply and <b>demand</b>, and uses equations to predict consequences of decisions. The fundamental assumption underlying traditional economic theory is the utility-maximizing rule.<p>
