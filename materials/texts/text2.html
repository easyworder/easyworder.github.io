	<p>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the official name of the country situated in the British Isles. The two main islands are Great Britain and Ireland. They are separated from the continent by the English Channel and the Strait of Dover. The UK consists of 4 parts - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.<br>
	In the north the country is washed by the Atlantic Ocean, in the west - by the Irish Sea, in the east - by the North Sea. When you travel about the country you can see different kinds of scenery: highlands and lowlands, forests and hills, meadows and plains. Britain is an unusually beautiful country!
	There are no very long rivers in the UK. The most important rivers are the Thames (the deepest) and the Severn (the longest). The capital of England - London - stands on the Thames. Each part of the UK has its own capital. The capital of Scotland is Edinburgh, the capital of Wales is Cardiff and the capital of Northern Ireland is Belfast.<br>
	The population of the UK is about 60 million people. Many of them live in big industrial cities such as Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, York and Newcastle.
