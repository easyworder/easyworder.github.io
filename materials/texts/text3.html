	<h1>Healthy Way of Life</h1>
	<img src="../../img/text3.jpg" style="width: 252px; height: 142px;">
	<p>People nowadays are more health-conscious than they used to be. They understand that good health is above wealth.<br>
	To be healthy we should avoid different bad <b>habits</b>. To my mind smoking and drinking too much alcohol are the worst ones. It's common knowledge that smoking and drinking can shorten our lives dramatically. Smoking, for example, causes a number of heart and lung diseases such as pneumonia and <b>cancer</b>. As for me.<br>
	Another problem of the modern world is overweight. We eat too much fat and sugar and don't exercise enough. A lot of people like fast food: pizza, hamburgers, French fries and different soft drinks. The result is very sad - high blood pressure, heart <b>diseases</b>, etc. But what is tasty is not always healthy. And many people start to change their eating habits. Salads, fish, vegetables and fruit have taken place of macaroni and potato. Shops and supermarkets sell low fat foods. Many people try to count the number of calories in their dishes. So the fashion of healthy food is growing all the time.<br>
	And of course you can't be healthy without <b>exercises</b>. Walking or <b>jogging</b>, skiing or skating, playing football or swimming - everything is OK. But you need patience. Keeping fit is something you should do regularly and for a long time. If you don't you won't have any effect.<br>
	It is also very important to spend a lot of time in the open air. That's why I try to go for a walk every day.<br>
	I believe everybody should take care of his health and keep fit. Just follow some simple rules: sleep eight or nine hours, get up early, have regular meals, keep to a healthy diet and do some <b>exercises</b><br><p>
